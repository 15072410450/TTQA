certain c library files show multiple include files at the top for instance , man connect shows synopsis include sys types h include sys socket h however , in order to call the connect command , only including sys socket h is necessary why do they arrange source code so that including another file is also necessary ? are there cases where you wish to avoid including sys types h ?	from the linux man page notes section posix 1 2001 does not require the inclusion of sys types h , and this header file is not required on linux however , some historical ( bsd ) implementations required this header file , and portable applications are probably wise to include it i guess that is why the mac man page includes sys types h as well
