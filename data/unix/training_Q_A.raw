in my organization for routing we are using 32 bit os rather than using 64 bit os on a host with 3gb ram since 64 bit faster than 32 bit why do sometimes people use 32 bit os rather than 64 bit does 32 bit os require less resource than 64 bit also on 64 bit os , is the size of page table entry 64 bit ?	the advantage of a 32 bits os is that you can install it on 32 or 64 bits hardware , while 64 bits os can only be installed on 64 bits hardware the size of a page table entry is 64 bits , but on current systems addresses are only implemented on 48 bits ( which allow only 256 tb instead of 16 eb )

what is the count default in dd command if not specified ? dd if dev mem bs 1k skip 768 instead of full form like dd if dev mem bs 1k skip 768 count 50 i did not find an answer with google	count means amounts of blocks to copy from man page count n copy only n input blocks it means amount of times to copy each block of input file block size specified by bs parameter if you wont to specify count parameter , dd will read write until the end of input file so , there is no default numberic value , only eof
i remembered reading one question how would you back up the mbr of a disk two of the choices are dd if dev sda of dev sdb bs 512 count 1 dd if dev sda of dev sdb bs 440 count 1 and the correct answer is dd if dev sda of dev sdb bs 440 count 1 i am confused is the mbr size 440b or 512b ?	the mbr ( master boot record ) is 512 bytes 446 bytes bootloader 64 bytes ( 4 16 bytes ) partition tables 2 bytes magic number which is aa55h however these values are for generic mbr , you can see other mbr structures from https en wikipedia org wiki master boot record anyway you have to backup hole 512 bytes of mbr with dd ( disk to disk ) command
